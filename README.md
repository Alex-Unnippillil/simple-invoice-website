# simple-invoice-website

Basic rent invoicing system that records payments and generates printable/PDF rent receipts.

## Deposit Tracking

This demo now includes rudimentary support for security deposits:

- Invoice and record deposit payments.
- Track ledger entries for deposit transactions.
- Create move-out flow that generates deposit refund receipts.
- Render a simple HTML table showing deposit history and outstanding balances.

The implementation is contained in `lease.py` and is intended as a minimal example.
